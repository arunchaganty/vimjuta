******************************    anjuta-gvim plugin     ******************************Warning: This plugin is still very unstable. Use at your own caution.This is a very young release of anjuta-gvim. There are still plenty of bugs,and plenty of features missing. Also, as of now, the 'EditorMultiple'support has not been accepted upstream, and you will need to patch anjutamanually. I hope you like this plugin.Homepage: http://code.google.com/p/anjuta-gvim/Bugs: http://code.google.com/p/anjuta-gvim/issues/listAuthor: Arun Tejasvi Chaganty <arunchaganty@gmail.com>Installation instructions:* Get an svn pull of anjuta.    svn co svn://svn.gnome.org/svn/anjuta/trunk anjuta* Apply the patch found in misc/ (editor_multiple.diff)    cp misc/editor_multiple.diff ~/anjuta/    cd ~/anjuta/    patch < editor_multiple.diff     (cross fingers)* run Autogenerate, build    ./autogen    make    make install* Run Anjuta.Note:   Vim has a lot of plugins that don't like to play nice. I can't possibly try   and find a solution for all of them, but I'd be happy to know about them, so   I can try my best. Here is a list of plugins that require a bit of tweaking   to get working properly.   * MiniBufExplorer: I *highly* recommend you use. However, I have found   * certain issues while closing the editor, that arise with the default   * settings. Add this line to your vimrc to solve this issue:        let g:miniBufExplorerMoreThanOne=1     It always keeps the miniBufExplorer window open. In case you don't want to    use this option, enter :buffer (bufno) and try closing the window again.
